The data is aggregated to Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3), according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.<br/><br>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3235.02017?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3235.0Explanatory%20Notes12017?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the data.</li>\n<li>Regions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa3_code16","type":"String","title":"SA3 Code","description":"SA3 Code.","isDimension":false},{"name":"females_age_0_4","type":"Integer","title":"Number of Females aged 0 -
