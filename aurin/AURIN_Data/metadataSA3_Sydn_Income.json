This dataset is based on the Statistical Area Level 3 2016 boundaries, and covers data for individual years between 2011 and 2018. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of income: Estimates of Personal Income, Gross Capital Gains, Selected Government Pensions and Allowances, Total Personal Income (Weekly) and Equivalised Total Household Income.<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 1410.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br/><br/>\n\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1410.0Explanatory%20Notes12013-18?OpenDocument#INCOME\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nNotes: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1410.02013-18?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Some data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.</li>\n<li>Where data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.</li>\n<li>Columns that did not contain any values for all years in the original data have been removed.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"yr","type":"String","title":"Year","description":"Year.","stype":"ordinal","categories":[{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2012","label":"2012"},{"key":"2013","label":"2013"},{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2017","label":"2017"},{"key":"2018","label":"2018"}],"filterValue":"2016","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa3_code16","type":"String","title":"SA3 Code 2016","description":"SA3 Code 2016.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"eq_t_hs_inc_fam_lone_grp_hslds_med_eq_t_hs_inc_wk_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Equivalised Total Household Income - Family, Lone Person And Group Households Median Equivalised Total Household Income (Weekly) $","description":"Equivalised Total Household Income - Family, Lone Person And Group Households Median Equivalised Total Household Income (Weekly) $.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_p_inc_avg_emply_inc_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Employee Income $","description":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Employee Income $.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_p_inc_avg_investment_inc_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Investment Income $","description":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Investment Income $.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_p_inc_avg_own_unincorportd_bsns_inc_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Own Unincorporated Business Income $","description":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Own Unincorporated Business Income $.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_p_inc_avg_super_annuity_inc_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Superannuation And Annuity Income $","description":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Superannuation And Annuity Income $.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_p_inc_avg_tot_inc_excl_gov_pnsn_aud","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates Of Personal Income Mean Total Income (Excl.
